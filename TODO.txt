In no particular order:


a) Make the server_side save_graph, i.e. essence_method.update_model clean up any empty nodes after the attempt to save data.
b) Make the server respond with some json so the client can update already-realized node ids.
c) Make the client keep a list of deleted nodes, so that it can be sent to server as well, heh.
d) Is there a better way to store the relation_maker from than in ctool.element?




CRISIS:
The action_stack and node.ids and saving don't play well together at the moment, since
the saving means the ids change, which can lead to some odd results when moving through
the history.

Solution: overwrite the history frames to use the new nodes???!?!??!!!?

Also the saving itself might take some rework since it gives a 500 error sometimes.
Particularly if you've saved a deletion, and then undo and try to save again,
since the server then looks for a node which no longer exists in the db...
