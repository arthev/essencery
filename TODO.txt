In no particular order:


a) Make the server_side save_graph, i.e. essence_method.update_model clean up any empty nodes after the attempt to save data.
b) Make the server respond with some json so the client can update already-realized node ids.
c) Make the client keep a list of deleted nodes, so that it can be sent to server as well, heh.
